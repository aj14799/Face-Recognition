# Face-Recognition
A Minor Small project which trains the dataset of Images and afterward can be use for face detection of that person. I the project i used numpy, openCV and faceRecognition python packages. For front face training data i used the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file. 

And yml file (i.e., trainingData.yml) use temporarily which is commented in my code as we can use yml file to train data also.

(Face Recognition using OpenCV in Python)


## How to run code

Run tester.py script on powershell or cmd to train and recogniz on training images and to predict test images:


### =============== Prerequisites ================
=> Numpy :- pip install numpy


=> OpenCV :- run pip install opencv-contrib-python


=> FaceRecognition :- pip install face-recognition

####  ============ Command for Annaconda Prompt =========

=> Numpy :- conda install numpy

=> OpenCV :- conda install -c menpo opencv

=> FaceRecognition :- conda install -c akode face_recognition_models


Note: Please install opencv-contrib-python package instead of opencv-contrib as it contains the main modules and also contrib modules.


### ============= Images =====================

# Face-Recognition
A Minor Small project which trains the dataset of Images and afterward can be use for face detection of that person. I the project i used numpy, openCV and faceRecognition python packages. For front face training data i used the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file and yml file (i.e., trainingData.yml) temporarily.

(Face Recognition using OpenCV in Python)

### =============== Prerequisites ================
=> Numpy :- pip install numpy


=> OpenCV :- run pip install opencv-contrib-python


=> FaceRecognition :- pip install face-recognition

####  ============ Command for Annaconda Prompt =========

=> Numpy :- conda install numpy

=> OpenCV :- conda install -c menpo opencv

=> FaceRecognition :- conda install -c akode face_recognition_models


Note: Please install opencv-contrib-python package instead of opencv-contrib as it contains the main modules and also contrib modules.
